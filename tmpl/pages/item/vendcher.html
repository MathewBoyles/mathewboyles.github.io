        <p>Vendcher was created to simplify vouchers. It allowed for users to add, redeem, and add funds to vouchers. It was designed to work with many POS systems.</p>
        <p>Vendcher was created for <a href="#!/item/mybelle">Mybelle</a> and is not available to download or use at this time.</p>

            <h5 class="primary-font info-title info-title-first">Add &amp; Spend Vouchers</h5>
            <p>The Vendcher system allowed for users to create vouchers and for them to redeem credit from them at check-out.</p>

            <h5 class="primary-font info-title">Categories</h5>
            <p>Categories could be used on vouchers so they may be easily managed. Some uses of this feature included vouchers issued for loyalty and vouchers issued as a refund. Categorization also allowed a view of which type of voucher was being used when at check-out.</p>

            <h5 class="primary-font info-title">Activity Log</h5>
            <p>An activity log was kept so expenditures and other actions could be viewed for each voucher.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-sm-6">
            <h5 class="primary-font info-title visible-xs-block">Users &amp; Permissions</h5>
            <h5 class="primary-font info-title info-title-first hidden-xs">Users &amp; Permissions</h5>
            <p>Multiple user accounts could be created - each with specific permissions. This was also reflected in the activity log, which allowed an administrator to see which user/staff member was redeeming vouchers.</p>

            <h5 class="primary-font info-title">Import &amp; Export</h5>
            <p>Don't lose a thing. The import and export feature allowed for back-ups to be generated.</p>

            <h5 class="primary-font info-title">Dashboard</h5>
            <p>The dashboard gives an overview of voucher performance, including how much was spent and when. This information could also be easily printed.</p>
