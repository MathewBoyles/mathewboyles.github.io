        <p>Hi, I'm Mathew - I'm a full-stack web developer and tech enthusiast. Ever since I was young, I have had an interest in creating websites and other digital things. I started while still in primary school, working with basic site builders. I now develop and code in HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and more.</p>
        <p>I work on projects both for clients and for fun, ranging from e-commerce to social networking applications. I also have experience in graphic design, which includes marketing materials for flyer distribution, branding, and social media campaigns.</p>
        <p>I currently work freelance. If you have an idea or project you want to be developed, feel free to get in touch!</p>

      <h2>Why web design &amp; development?</h2>
      <p>Like a lot of people, I love to create things and seeing an idea come to life. Web design &amp; development has been an interest of mine since a young age, and I've rolled with it.</p>
